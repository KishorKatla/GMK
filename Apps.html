           We know that a lot of work went into creating and establishing your   brand. We understand that your mobile applications will be an extension   of that brand, so GMK Software Solutions strives to create a seamless   brand experience that connects you and your customers in the most   engaging ways.<br>
           <br>
As a full-service mobile application development company, we can take   your idea from concept through to delivery on a variety of different   platforms—such as iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch, Android, Android Tablet,   Kindle Fire, and Microsoft Windows—and you can involve yourself in the   process as much or as little as you like.<br>
<br>
The need to have an app of your own becomes more urgent and obvious with   each passing day, as consumers increasingly choose to interact with   businesses through wireless mobile devices. It's no longer a luxury, but   a convenience they have grown to expect— communication, service,   entertainment and research needs must be accessible at their fingertips,   no matter where they happen to be. By responding to this demand and   developing apps that allow them to connect conveniently, smart   businesses, manufacturers, and service providers are strategically   positioning themselves as attentive, responsive and sensitive to their   customers' needs.<br>
<br>
We see it across the board—and we see it in our own numbers:
<ul class="list-1">
  <li>We have created over 100 new apps for customers in just the last eight months</li>
  <li>Users of our unique App Engine product have sent more than 200,000   push notification messages to their customers within the last 6 months   alone.</li>
  <li>Technology research leader Gartner, Inc., predicts 185 billion   mobile app downloads by 2014, and also forecasts that by 2015,   applications targeting smartphone and tablets will outnumber PC projects   4 to 1, representing more than 90% of new growth in the world's device   sales.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h2>The Nuts and Bolts:</h2>
Our process begins and ends with communication:<br>
<br>
<strong>Step One-Understand:</strong> We gather information about you, your   company, your process, your product, your philosophy, your customers,   your goals, and finally, your idea of what an app should do for you.<br>
<br>
<strong>Step Two-Plan:</strong> Our team of experienced visionary app builders can   take your idea from concept through delivery on a variety of platforms.   We believe that creating the ideal app depends on a close working   partnership with each client while we develop, improve, and extend the   app solution.<br>
<br>
<strong>Step Three-Design:</strong> Our custom code libraries allow our developers   access to large repositories of source code, enabling them to reuse the   most common features and functions for rapid integration into any   mobile app. This process translates into an exceptionally speedy   time-to- market timeframe, accomplished without skimping or compromising   on functionality or quality. <br>
<br>
<strong>Step Four- Build:</strong> We have perfected our   product iteration cycle to focus on producing a viable product at the   first opportunity. We want to build the best quality software for you,   and one that works with your existing technology infrastructure.<br>
<br>
<strong>Step Five- Test:</strong> It is important to both of us that the software   you get is the software you needed. We pay attention to the details,   pour emotion into our work, and sweat the details, testing, checking,   and rechecking the final app product.<br>
<br>
<strong>Step Six-Market:</strong> Let's get it out there! We can help you with your go-to-market strategies<br>
<br>
